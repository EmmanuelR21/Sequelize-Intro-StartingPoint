# üóÑÔ∏è Intro Sequelize

## Getting Started

This project uses Express.js to serve up an API server, and Sequelize to connect to a PostgreSQL database. You should start by forking or cloning this repo, and then adding your teammates as collaborators.

Then, follow the same steps we've been following:

```
npm install
npm run start-dev
```

This project runs in the Node.js runtime environment. We're not using Webpack here, but we are using a tool called nodemon, which re-runs our app whenever we save a file. You should see a message in the terminal telling you that the server is running on port 8080.

When an error occurs on the backend (Express), you'll see a message in the terminal. When an error occurs on the frontend (React), you'll see that error in the browser.

This app also connects to a database called todo_list. You must create that database manually.

## Deployment

This project has a vercel.json file, which will make it easier to deploy this project to Vercel. You will need to:

1. Create a Hobby Vercel account (free)
2. Connect your GitHub account. You can do this on sign up.
3. Add a new project. You should see a list of your recent GitHub repos. Find this one.
4. Select Import. The default options should be just fine. Click confirm and wait a few minutes.
5. You'll be assigned a random public URL ‚Äì it will be very long! Try it out by pasting the URL in the browser, and then also in Postman.
